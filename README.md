## Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Search &amp; Rescue

### Abstract:
The project shall use an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to view an area, identify a target and send the target relative coordinates to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). UAV access the position and distance from the target by using its camera and autonomously approach the target while optimizing the path or finding the shortest distance to the goal by using genetic algorithm.

### Introduction:
Search & Rescue, as the name implies, describes a target seeking task followed by a target approach by a second agent. The term is used in danger situations, i.e. a lost person, or perhaps seeking survivors after a disaster. The project will have a UGV locating a target followed by a UAV approaching the located target.
The project will be implemented using MATLAB. The UGV, a Clearpath Labs Jackal robot, shall be guided by implementing a Path Planning method in either Python or MATLAB, using the Clearpath Navigation Guide [1]. The UGV shall use Synchronized Localization and Mapping, SLAM, [2], to recognize the surrounding environment while simultaneously seeking the target. SLAM is the process of mapping an environment while keeping track of the UGV location. The target shall be either a QR code or a high-contrast object. Upon locating the target the UGV map and location data will be used by the UAV, a DJI Tello drone, to give the drone the target location. The UAV shall use Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) in MATLAB to autonomously access the position and distance to the target. 

### Problem Statement:
Build a search & rescue robot system using a UGV, a Clearpath Robotics Jackal, to find a target and a UAV, a DJI Tello drone, to follow to the target. The UAV will be given a minimum distance from the target before being commanded to land. 
### Related Work:
Earlier studies have focused on the search & rescue by having the trailing agent follow in real time, referred to as a leader-follower problem. With multiple followers the agents, demonstrated by Gonfalonieri et al., [3], a swarm of follower UAV drones or UGV ground vehicles will get distance and position data from the nearest neighbors, each unit using the data to avoid collisions while still following the leader, either at a constant or variable velocity.(Ghapani et al. [4] & Park et al. [5]) Our implementation will avoid the real-time leader-follower, the trailing agent only seeking the target after the leader has determined the target location.  
The UGV shall use Path Planning to seek and create the path to the target. A previous study implemented SLAM and Path Planning via Robot Operating System (ROS v1) (Batavia [6]). The method used a LIDAR-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) called Gmapping, to create a 2-D grid map of a 3D scanned environment. In a ROS Gazebo simulation, the simulated LIDAR unit on a simulated four wheel robot is used to scan the viewed area and produce a 2D map using a TF transformation. In motion, the robot position is estimated by a combination of (a) ‘dead reckoning’, which is calculating the distance and angle from an initial point, and (b) ‘Monte-Carlo localization’, which is comparing LIDAR scan data with a map. The combined methods give the robot an estimation of both position and orientation. Our project will forgo the AMCL on the SLAM generation as our test area will be a controlled indoor environment.
The UAV shall use localization using the AMCL algorithm coupled with the base of the map data generated by the Jackal LIDAR SLAM. Triangulation matching, i.e. calculating the distance of the drone from pairs of laser reflectors, can enhance the AMCL algorithm localization of the drone as executed in a previous study [7] by Zhou et al. The laser reflection method requires additional hardware which is currently not available so the UAV localization accuracy will rely solely on the AMCL camera evaluation.

### Methodology:
* Implement MATLAB control of DJI Tello using the MATLAB Tello add-on. The Tello add-on, written by DJI, has function calls to direct the drone
* Implement control of the Clearpath Robotics Jackal robot using MATLAB through Robot Operating System (ROS) commands. As with the Tello drone, the MATLAB code to maneuver the Jackal robot has functions that controls the Jackal robot
* Create environment map using SLAM using Jackal. The UGV Jackal uses LIDAR to scan and map the environment.  The UGV repetitively calculates a local position based on wheel rotation and inertia sensors
* The UGV continuously scans to locate the target. Upon locating the target, the drone will use the same map data as the basis for AMCL target locating
* Write MATLAB code for AMCL control of drone. The map optimization is a re-mapping using a particle filter which evaluates the SLAM image against the discrete camera images on a loop, giving a score to each. The images with the highest score is considered most accurate and the localization of the drone is adjusted to the new position 
* Implement drone ability to identify QR code target or high-contrast target. The drone camera will evaluate a camera image for objects that fit the target description
* Implement AMCL evaluation of target on drone. The drone will evaluate the AMCL corrected distance to the target for a minimum distance, then land
* Complete documentation.
